# LEARN BOOTSTRAP 4: UTILITIES AND COMPONENTS

## Review

> Go ahead and give yourself that well-deserved pat on the back, you’ve worked your way through Bootstrap utility classes and components!

> Remember, it is extremely important to check Bootstrap documentation for instructions on component implementation!

> Because we checked documentation we were able to use:

- animations and interactivity that requires the addition of Bootstrap’s JavaScript files.
- utility classes which affect the styling and position of elements.
- the nav component provides default Bootstrap styling to links.
- the responsive navbar component to quickly navigate between webpages.
- the jumbotron component which prominently displays an image or text.
- the card component that acts as a stylized content container.
- collapse to toggle component visibility.
- the carousel component to create a slideshow which displays images or text.
> Now, go forth and see what else you can bootstrap to your site!
